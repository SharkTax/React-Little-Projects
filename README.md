# Hi everyone this is just junky projects i make to train React

just this Here you can see my progress through my projects, what i like to call "crap", so basically little projects, that i`ve made or some course i follow up in youtube, this repository will be very important to me

## why??

because some times i can forget how to code some thing, and this repository will always be here to remember how to do, or how it works

probably in a while i will be posting something cool in my profile. But for now just an crap repository 

### `Thanks for reading`
