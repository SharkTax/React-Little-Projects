# Hi everyone this is just junky projects i make to train React

just this Here you can see my progress through my projects, what i like to call "crap", so basically little projects, that i`ve made or some course i follow up in youtube, this repository will be very important to me

## why??

because some times i can forget how to code some thing, and this repository will always be here to remember how to do, or how it works

probably in a while i will be posting something cool in my profile. But for now just an crap repository 

#how does it works?

so when i commit a new little project from my machine i make a new branch, i will merge with the master branch, an after that i delete the other little projects from the branch of the main project i`ve commited.

basicaly inside each branch you will see just one component, but inside the master you will see all the little projects
